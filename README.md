## Development

If you wish to build additional functionality into the application, development dependencies, unit tests, and convenient npm scripts are available in this repository. First, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `npm i`.

Once the operation is complete, `npm start` will compile the TypeScript to JavaScript in the `/dist/` directory. It will also watch the `/src/` directory for changes to the source TypeScript files, and transpile them to JavaScript in the `/dist/` directory as you edit.

You can run the test suite with `npm test` to help determine if the basic functionality of the application is intact.

## Deployment

When ready to deploy the application, serve the contents of the `/dist/` directory from your web server.
