# Building
Maquette is written in Typescript. The main sourcefile can be found under `src/maquette.ts`. Unit-tests are in the `test` folder.

While making modifications to maquette, we recommend you run the `gulp dev` command in the background.
This will watch the sourcefiles to compile, test and measure code coverage constantly.
It will also open a live updating browser-window displaying the code coverage.

For `bower`, we also include a compiled and minified version in git. These can be updated using by running the `gulp` command.

Happy coding!
